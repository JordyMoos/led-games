[You can check this video tutorial explaining how the project works](https://youtu.be/Hp4fiNjiIkM)

## Installation

Check out the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:JordyMoos/led-games.git
```

### Configure the led controller

The leds are controller by a [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32_pins.html) and the code is located here:
```
./src/led-controller/led-controller.ino
```

You should change these values to match your led setup.
```
const int ledsPerStrip = 100;
const int strips = 8;
```

And after that you should upload that file to your Teensy.


[See the official teensy documentation how that is done.](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)


### Run the game engine

Go to the game engine directory
```
cd src/game-engine
```

Install the python dependencies
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the game engine:
```
python3 ./main.py run snake
```

**Tip**:
Use the virtual renderer if you do not have the leds
```
python3 ./main.py run snake --renderer PYGAME
```

Use the `list` command to view the games
```
python3 ./main.py list
```

Run the command with the `-h` flag to see the options
```
python3 ./main.py run -h
```

**Optionally**:
You can change the default settings in `defaults.py`
